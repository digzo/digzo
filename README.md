- 👋 Hi, I’m @digzo
- 👀 I’m interested in the conservation of energy...
How can the forces in a pendulum be measured?
The energy present is kinetic and potential energy.
Start by defining the forces
1 the swinging force (momentum)
2 the up n down force as the weight swings (put a tension metre in the line from which the pendulum bobweight is suspended, and this will prove that the weight changes as the pendulum changes while it swings through the arc)(change is a source of energy:power)
3 consider a child on a swing: to gain momentum, they flip forward or flop back to increase it... can the change in bob weight as it swings, be used to make a counterweight flip-flop back and forth, when the pendulum reaches the extent of it's swing?
So (3) above is my thesis.

What do you think?
Let me know if I need to explain more
